# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.
#
# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
#
# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
#
# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]
#
# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}" to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 square, each on a new line.
#
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇

# Find the vertical and horizontal coordinates, if they start at 1
vertical   = int(position[0]) - 1
horizontal = int(position[1]) - 1

map[horizontal][vertical] = "X"

#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
